Python versions
---------------
2.x and 3.x 

2.x
----
print "hello world"

3.x
---
print("hello world")

3.13
----
A new and improved interactive interpreter, based on PyPy's, featuring multi-line editing and color support, as well as colorized exception tracebacks. An experimental free-threaded build mode, which disables the Global Interpreter Lock, allowing threads to run more concurrently


Flavours of Python
------------------
CPython - Currently using

Jython  - Convert python code to Java code

Iron Python - use to interact with dotnet Libraries


IDE
---
IDLE - create files

PyCharm CE - 
VScode CE 

Eclipse - addon
sublime text

Jupyter Notebook
Spyder

google colabs

Notepad
Notepad++

Python
------
Python SDK - used to execute your python code

shell - interactive environment

IDLE - GUI

two operators that are overloaded by default
--------------------------------------------
+ = can be used to
      1. add numbers
      2. concatenate strings

* = can be used to
      1. multiply numbers
      2. print a string n number of times


Primary Data type in python
---------------------------
1. Stings
2. Numbers
   a. integer
   b. long (deprecated)
   c. float
   d. complex
3. Boolean

long

Virtual Environment
-------------------


Coding Rules
------------
#!  = shebang - used to specify the path of Python executables

Line termination is your return key (enter key)

Comments
--------
# - is used to create comments in python

strings are enclosed in " " or  ' '

"hello world"
'hello world'

multiple line strings

"""
this is the first line
this is the second line
this is the third line
"""

'''
this is the first line
this is the second line
this is the third line
'''

in python we don't depend on parenthesis '( { ['

we use indentation to write a block of code

def fun():
    print("hello world")
    
    for i in range(1, 21):
	 print("xyz")
	 if (i % 2 == 0):
              print(i)

    print("abc")

fun()

Python is case sensitive

a != A

count != Count

Primitive Data types
--------------------
1. Numbers
   a. integers
   b. float
   c. complex


2. Strings


Operators
---------
1. arithmetic ->  +, -, *, /, //, %
2. augmenter  ->  +=, -=, /=
3. comparison ->  ==, >, <, >=, <=, !=
4. logical    ->  and, or, not 
5. bitwise    ->  |, &, ^, >>, <<
6. ternary    ->  if condition in a single line
