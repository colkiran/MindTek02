Packages and Modules
---------------------
Modules
-------
what are modules?

1. module as same as libraries 

2. any python file can be considered as a module

3. modules will have the same extension as a python file (.py)

4. we use modules in our code by importing a module

import sys

modules can have 
----------------

a. variables

b. lists, dictionary, tuples, sets

c. functions

d. classes


Package
-------
what is a package?

package is a folder or directory

package will have modules stored inside

packages are compared with classes

whenever we call a class - the constructor will get executed (__init__() method)

whenever we use a package = __init__.py file will get executed


when we try to import a module 

1. .py will get converted into .pyc file (compiled copy) and will be stored in __pycache__ folder

2. python will read the .pth file from python native path and import the path into its library path so the modules in that location gets executed

3. python will compare the date and time of creation of .py and .pyc file. python will expect the .pyc file to have latest date and time compared to .py file
