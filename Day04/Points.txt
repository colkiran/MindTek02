Factorial of a number using recursive call. (Prob03.py)

In python we can return more than one value

Functions - pass by value and pass by reference

def fun(x):
   x = 50

y = 10
fun(y)  - pass by value - we will pass only the value of y
        - pass by reference -  we will pass the address of y along with value

print(y)  - if y gets updated then it is pass by reference else it is pass by value

Data types
----------
1. mutable - it can be changed at any time
2. immutable - once created we cannot change its value


mutable   - pass by reference - list, dictionary, set
immutable - pass by value - numbers, strings and tuple


price = 50

def GST(prc):
   gst = prc * 0.018
   prc = prc + gst


GST(price)
print(price)

Lambdas
-------
lambdas as anonymous functions with a single expression

result_of_the_exp = lambda x, y, z.. : expression_with_variables


assignment
----------
1. convert these expenses from rupees to dollars
exp = [5000, 8500, 6000, 30000, 15000, 84500, 65000, 98000, 150000]


Scope of a variable
-------------------
1. global	
2. local
3. non local


Functions
---------
1. closures
2. HOF
3. Decorator (function)
