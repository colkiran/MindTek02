Open the file and perform actions dynamically

to move the file handle we use seek

POSITION = SEEK(OFFSET, WHENCE)

OFFSET  - number of bytes that we want to skip

WHENCE - 0   - count starts from BOF
         1   - count starts from the CP
         2   - count starts from the EOF


seek(50, 0)	- 50 bytes is calculated from BOF

seek(75, 1)	- 75 bytes from the current position (125th byte)


1. FL.seek(85, 0)

2. FL.seek(75, 1)

3. FL.seek(-50, 1)

4. FL.seek(100, 2)

5. FL.seek(-300, 2)

6. FL.seek(-50, 0)

2. JSON file

its a text file that stores structed data in the format called Java Script Object Notation(JSON). JSON is a popular format for exchanging data between systems especially for web applications

a. JSON files are used to data between servers to web pages and vice versa
b. JSON files are used to exchange data between different programming languages and platforms
3. JSON files are used to simplify the exchange the data between programming languages and platforms
4. JSON files can represent the same data in a smaller file size for faster data transfer


3. XML - Extensible Markup Language

DOM  - currently using this to read xml file


4. Excel

Python  - communicate with excel - we need a driver - openpyxl

Excel file - Workbook

excel pages - Worksheet

each sheet has a grid

the grid has rows and columns

row are numbered and horizontally placed
row number are sequential - 1, 2, 3, 4, .... 1048576

columns are labeled or named with alphabets
column names are like - A, B, C,....Z, AA, AB, AC, AD.......XFD(16384)

intersection of rows and columns are called as cells
each cell has an address (combination of colname and rowno)

A1, A35, B105, C1, D5
